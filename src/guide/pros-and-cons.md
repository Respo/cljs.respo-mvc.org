Pros
----

* Pure CojureScript, immutable by default with optimizations
* Global states, hot swapping is smoother
* Flexible HTML DSL with ClojureScript
* No side effects, less position to make mistakes
* Atom and pure functions makes Store very clear
* Virtual DOM is data that we can manipulate
* Better support for progressive rendering
* Component state can be any type than an shallow Object

Cons
----

* Not as fast as React.js
* No side effects, people may need that
* No support for animations
* ClojureScript ecosystem now as powerful as Webpack
* Far fewer components
* Warnings are not friendly, bad factor for debugging
* Rendered DOM looks intensive and ugly
