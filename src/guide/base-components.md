Base components
----

There are some base components for building apps built inside Respo:

```clojure
respo.comp.text/comp-text
respo.comp.space/comp-space
respo.comp.debug/comp-debug
```

Also I got some simple component to help:

* [`respo-ui`](http://github.com/Respo/respo-ui) for base styles
* [`respo-value`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-value) for displaying values
* [`respo-border`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-border) for renderng borders
* [`respo-inflow-pop`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-inflow-pop) for local popups
* [`respo-router`](https://github.com/Respo/respo-router) for routering(Respo not required)
* [`notifyer`](https://github.com/Respo/notifier) for showing notifications(Respo not required)

Respo components are pure, without side effects.
