Why Respo?
----

There are quite some alternative actually: Reagent, React, Deku, or maybe Rum.
Om is a bit too complicated to me.

The different thing of Respo is, its built totally in ClojureScript.
So persistent data structure from scratch.
It can be too simple for real world apps that requires lots of side effects.
but it fine to build middle size apps and to experiments with Respo.
Respo is designed carefully to maintain global store and global states,
so hot code swapping is quite predictable.

For short, it's simpler, meanwhile purer.
