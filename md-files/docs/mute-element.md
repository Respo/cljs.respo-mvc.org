## `mute-element`

This function removes events from a virtual DOM tree:

```clojure
(mute-element element)
```

When server side rendering is used, the first screen does not respond to events.
That can be seen as rendered with a virtual DOM with no events.
So `mute-element` is used to simulate such a virtual DOM tree.
