## DOM properties

Respo is updating DOM properties with a simple solution. It's okay but not that friendly. Here are some example on the name mapping:

Property name | Respo name
--- | ---
`className` | `:class-name`
`innerText` | `:inner-text`
`innerHTML` | `:innerHTML`
`value` | `:value`

I'm afraid you have to figure out more by yourself.

Properties(except for `style` and `event`) are specified in `attrs` field. `style` is a HashMap. `event` is followed with a HashMap of events too.

The impelementation details is:

```clojure
(defn replace-prop [target op]
  (let [prop-name (dashed->camel (name (key op))) prop-value (val op)]
    (if (= prop-name "value")
      (if (not= prop-value (.-value target))
        (aset target prop-name prop-value))
      (aset target prop-name prop-value))))

(defn add-prop [target op]
  (let [prop-name (dashed->camel (name (key op))) prop-value (val op)]
    (case
      prop-name
      "style"
      (aset target prop-name (style->string prop-value))
      (aset target prop-name prop-value))))

(defn rm-prop [target op] (aset target (dashed->camel (name op)) nil))
```
