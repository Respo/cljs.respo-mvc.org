## Tutorial

I wrote a [Quick Start](https://github.com/Respo/respo/wiki/Quick-Start) before. It's quite short.

To learn Respo, I will suppose you have already known:

* [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.org)
* [Boot](boot-clj.com)
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo)

Respo is a ClojureScript implementation of virtual DOM as a research. It's like a purer version of React.js .

Here are some examples you can read to see how Respo works in real world apps:

* [respo-spa-example](https://github.com/Respo/respo-spa-example)
* [wanderlist](https://github.com/Memkits/wanderlist/)
* [respo-cirru-editor](https://github.com/Cirru/respo-cirru-editor)
* [recursive-tasks](https://github.com/Memkits/recursive-tasks)
* [stack-editor](https://github.com/Cirru/stack-editor)
* [respo-border](https://github.com/Respo/respo-border)
* [type-ahead-demo](https://github.com/Respo/type-ahead-demo)
